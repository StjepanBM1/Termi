# Termi
**If you want use non-OpenGL version, manually install files from commits history!**

**Syncing Windows version may not be regular!**

**[Latest stable release (v3.0.0)](https://github.com/ringwormGO-organization/Termi/releases/tag/v3.0.0)**

A Powerful terminal made in C++ with OpenGL and Dear ImGui with own commands

## Introducing Termi
Termi is a robust terminal application developed using C++. It's designed to be platform-independent and can operate on Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, BSD, and any other platforms that support the C++ standard library, .dll, .so files, and GLFW.

The primary objective of Termi is to establish an independent terminal that utilizes its own GUI rendering system. It supports commands written in C, C++, Rust, and potentially any language that can be compiled into a shared library.

- OpenGL & its dependencies
  - ### Windows
    #### Generating files (optional)
    - Check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpBGwZNyUh0) video and copy new files where old ones are.

    #### Continuing with installation
    - Visual Studio 2022 solution should work without any additional configuration.
    - If it doesn't work, see following instructions down below:
      1. open properties of solution,
      2. go to `VC++ Directories`,
      3. set path of `Include Directories` to `includes` folder,
      4. set path of `Library Directories` to `Termi-GUI` folder where `glfw3.lib` is located;
      5. if you get in trouble, check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpBGwZNyUh0) video.
  - ### macOS & (GNU/)Linux
    #### Generating files (optional)
      1. go to https://glad.dav1d.de/,
      2. generate glad with following properties:
          - `gl`: Version 3.3,
          - `Profile`: Core;
      3. download generated `glad.zip`,
      4. extract `glad.zip`,
      5. copy `./include/glad` folder to `/usr/include`,

    #### Continuing with installation
      1. install `glfw` package;
      2. if you get in trouble, check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIbJ5Iw0yAs) video.

  - ### BSD
    - Steps are same as for (GNU/Linux), but there is some notice:
      - The glfw header and libraries are installed on /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib (OpenBSD, other *BSD should be same)
      - The GL/gl.h header is installed on /usr/X11R6/include (OpenBSD)
      - I think the GL library is also installed on /usr/X11R6/lib

  *NOTE: There is option in `Settings.hpp` to use headers in this repository*

- Rust - required for building Rust commands (optional)
  - Check Rust's website for download instructions
  
**Commands which requires package installation have to be ran with administrator/root access!**

### Build & Run - Windows
1. Open `Developer Powershell for Visual Studio 2022`
2. Go to `Termi-Commands` folder/directory and run this command: `clear | cmake . | nmake`
3. Go to `Termi-GUI` folder/directory, make `build` folder/directory, enter it and run `cmake ..`, but before that set a path where is `json-c` installed using `vcpkg` in `CMakeLists.txt` and copy `glfw3.lib` in `build` folder/directory from `Termi-GUI` folder/directory
4. Go to `build` folder/directory, open Visual Studio solution and compile `ALL_BUILD` project
5. Go to `Termi-Main` folder and run this command: `clear | mkdir build | cd build | cmake ..`
6. Go to `build` folder/directory, open Visual Studio solution and compile `ALL_BUILD` project
7. Now copy all DLLs to `Debug` folder/directory where is `Termi-Main` executable for Windows located
8. Now run `Termi-Main` executable!

**Don't forget to use `Release` mode!**

### Build & Run - Other platforms
- Just run `compile_all.sh` (it won't compile test Rust command)
  - first argument is number of threads
  - second argument is do you want clean build
1. Compile `Termi-Commands` project by running `cmake . && make`
2. Compile `Termi-GUI` project by running `cmake . && make`
3. Copy `libTermi-GUI.so` and `libTermi-Commands.so` files into `Termi-Main` folder/directory.
4. Compile `Termi-Main` project by running ```cmake . && make && ./Termi-OpenGL```.

### For those who want know more
1. You can compile `rtest` Rust project by `cargo build` (and then copy .dll or .so file in folder/directory where are other .dll or .so files) if you want to have `yes` command mainly written in Rust 

## Known issues
- OpenGL might now open when reading from .txt file, remove `render->Settings(1, 0)` and `render->Settings(2, 0)` to size which you want.
- Dear ImGui might cause segmentation fault on BSD based operating systems **(we are fixing this currently)**.
- Running `Termi-Main` can result: `libTermi-GUI.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` error; run `Termi-Main` with this command: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./Termi-Main`.
- `cd` command disables autofocus on input bar.
- You have to press button for other themes (not light/dark) to be able to switch between light and dark themes.
